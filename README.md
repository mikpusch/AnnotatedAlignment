# AnnotatedAlignment
A tool for generation of annotated alignments with structural visualization

AnnotatedAlignment (AA) is a web interface to generate an interactive html web page for the simultaneously visualization of annotated protein sequences alignment and 3D structures or homology models of the related proteins. 


The physiological, functional, and structural properties of proteins and their pathogenic variants can be summarized using many tools. The amount of information relating to a single protein is quite large and often widespread in many different programs. It is not always easy or immediate to select or compare specific properties. On the other hand, the comparison of data from proteins belonging to the same protein family could suggest possible conserved properties or spotlight significant differences. We developed a web interface, called AnnotatedAlignment (AA), to generate a web page for the simultaneous visualization of a multi-sequence protein alignment and the three-dimensional protein structure. The distinctive feature of this web interface is that it permits the inclusion of comments and colored residues in the alignment section, in accordance with the color code specified by the properties that are being compared. The result is a unique web page that compares available data from different sources, with the flexibility to highlight only the information of interest.
